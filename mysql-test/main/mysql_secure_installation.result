In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for a privileged user. If you've just installed MariaDB, and
haven't set a privileged password yet, you should just press enter here.

For which user do you want to specify a password (press enter for USERNAME): 
Enter current password for user rootnnUSERNAMEnYnsecretnsecretnYnnn (enter for none): 
Only privileged user can make changes to mysql DB.
For which user do you want to specify a password (press enter for USERNAME): 
.my.output.47113
1
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

User: USERNAME and 1

You already have your user account protected (unix_socket auth and password set, or password impossible to use), so you can safely answer 'n'.

Set the user: USERNAME password? [Y/n]  ... skipping.

By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]  ... Success!

By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]  - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]  ... Success!

Cleaning up...

All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MariaDB!
